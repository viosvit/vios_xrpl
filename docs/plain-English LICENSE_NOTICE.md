# Plain-English License Notice

The VIOS protocol is **dual-licensed**:

- **Apache 2.0 (Open Core)**  
  You are free to use, modify, and contribute to the **core protocol** (Vaults, XRPL Hooks, SDKs) under the Apache 2.0 license. This ensures openness and community adoption.

- **Commercial License (Proprietary Extensions)**  
  Certain advanced components â€” Whisper Loopâ„¢, CIAâ„¢ Signatures, REEMâ„¢, and enterprise SDKs â€” are **not open-source**. These require a commercial license from M A Squared LLC.  

- **Why?**  
  This protects our IP while still enabling the XRPL and open-source community to build on top of VIOS.  
  Developers can use the open core freely, and enterprises can license premium modules as needed.
