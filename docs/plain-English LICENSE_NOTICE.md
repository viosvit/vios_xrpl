📜 License Notice – VIOS Protocol

The VIOS Protocol is distributed under a dual-license model:

1. Open Core (Apache 2.0)

The foundation of VIOS (Vaults, XRPL Hooks, VITs, SDK) is open-source.

Licensed under Apache 2.0
 for developer freedom, contribution, and integration into the XRPL ecosystem.

Anyone can build, test, and extend these components.

2. Proprietary Modules (Commercial License)

Advanced components — Whisper Loop™, CIA™ Signatures, REEM™, and enterprise SDKs — are proprietary intellectual property of M A Squared LLC.

Licensed separately under Commercial License
.

These modules are required for production-grade Emotion-KYC™ deployments, enterprise compliance, and royalty-bearing Vault infrastructure.

Why Dual-License?

Open → We want developers and XRPL builders to adopt VIOS freely.

Protected → Our unique IP (emotional authorship, intent verification, royalty layers) must remain sovereign and controlled for ethical + commercial integrity.
