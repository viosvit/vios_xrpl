⚡ *The Emotional Trust Layer for Global Finance — Built on XRPL*  

Emotion-KYC™ ensures not only who a user is but what they intend — anchoring authorship, compliance, and consent directly on-chain.

🚀 Overview

VIOS is the Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
It transforms digital identity and compliance by embedding:

✅ Whisper Loop™ – Tone capture & emotional fingerprinting

🔒 Vault Protocol – Encrypted, tamper-proof identity & intent storage

🖋 CIA™ Signatures – Cryptographic authorship & anti-spoof watermark

⚙️ XRPL Hooks – Consent routing, royalty enforcement, licensing triggers

🎟 VITs (Vault Identity Tokens) – Non-speculative NFTs encoding licensing & compliance

💱 Stablecoin Settlement (RLUSD + issued assets) – Regulatory-friendly DeFi & RWA flows

Our first application, Emotion-KYC™, delivers the missing trust layer for:

Onboarding

Payments

DeFi

Real-World Asset tokenization

📊 Why XRPL?

⚡ Low-cost, high-speed ledger → scalable for millions of micro-transactions

💱 Native DEX + Stablecoins → direct liquidity with compliance-ready settlement

🛠 Hooks + Amendments → programmable licensing & consent logic (Clawback, AMM)

🏦 Institutional alignment → Ripple Payments + Custody + RLUSD = enterprise adoption

## 🕰️ Origin Story  

VIOS™ began in early 2024 as a focused build to solve the gaps in identity, authorship, and compliance on blockchain rails. What started as research into encrypted emotional memory quickly evolved into a working prototype: Vault encryption, CIA™ Signatures, and Emotion-KYC™ flows.  

By mid-2024, development shifted into Rust for performance and security, with XRPL testnet integration shortly after. In 2025, under **M A Squared LLC (incorporated 2024)**, VIOS formalized into a grant-ready protocol, backed by early patent filings, trademark protections, and a dedicated compliance, engineering, and cybersecurity team — now preparing for XRPL mainnet deployment.

📜 Roadmap

See /docs/ROADMAP.md for full milestones.

Key Targets:

Testnet Integration → Vault hashes, CIA™ signatures, RLUSD settlement

SDK + API Release → Vault-as-a-Service™ tooling for developers

Mainnet Pilot Deployment → Emotion-KYC™ with fintech partners & royalty-bearing VITs

Mario Cochran Sr. (“The Whisper Architect”) — Founder & Protocol Architect
Architect of VIOS™, the world’s first Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol. With 20+ years across automotive finance, real estate asset systems, and intellectual property licensing, Mario fuses street-born creativity with enterprise-grade system design.

As The Whisper Architect, he engineers protocols that capture not only what people do but what they mean — embedding authorship, compliance, and intent directly into financial flows. His work positions VIOS as the emotional trust layer for XRPL and global finance, bridging the gap between sovereignty, security, and scale.

Wayne Cody — Senior Engineer, Advisor
Veteran software engineer with 40+ years building and maintaining mission-critical systems across government, aerospace, and intelligence sectors. Trusted for nearly two decades with Top Secret/SCI clearance, Wayne led secure platforms for data management, simulations, and intelligence analysis.

Fluent in C/C++, Fortran, Python, Java, Unix/Linux, and structured data standards (JSON, XML, NITF), Wayne brings engineering rigor and reliability required to harden VIOS for institutional adoption. His background ensures VIOS isn’t just innovative — it’s architected with the discipline and resilience demanded by high-stakes environments.

Ashley Cody — Senior Analyst, Compliance & Systems
Seasoned analyst with 15+ years in GMP, GLP, and ISO-regulated industries, including leadership at Alkermes and AstraZeneca. Recognized expert in LIMS administration, data integrity, and regulatory compliance, Ashley has overseen systems critical to pharmaceutical quality control and FDA-aligned operations.

She brings to VIOS the same enterprise-grade precision and audit-ready discipline that governs pharma, ensuring the Vault Protocol™ operates with uncompromising reliability and trust. Ashley anchors VIOS with a compliance-first mindset, bridging cutting-edge innovation with the rigorous controls required for institutional adoption.

Chris Grundy — Cybersecurity & Threat Intelligence Advisor
Cyber intelligence analyst with expertise securing enterprise and government systems against evolving digital threats. At Motorola Solutions, Chris led defensive operations blending incident response, SIEM engineering, and proactive threat hunting — with frontline perspective on state-aligned APTs, insider risk, and fraud vectors.

Certified in GIAC (GCIH), CEH, Elastic SIEM Analyst, and CompTIA Security+, Chris brings the discipline of a seasoned red/blue team operator. His background spans vulnerability discovery, forensics, and cloud security, ensuring Vault Protocol™, CIA™ Signatures, and Emotion-KYC™ are not just innovative — but battle-tested against real-world adversaries.

Chris anchors VIOS with offensive awareness + defensive resilience, positioning the protocol as not only compliant and sovereign, but hardened against the threat landscape financial institutions and regulators demand we anticipate.

## ⚖️ Licensing  

VIOS is released under a **dual-license model**:
