⚡ *The Emotional Trust Layer for Global Finance — Built on XRPL*  

Emotion-KYC™ ensures not only who a user is but what they intend — anchoring authorship, compliance, and consent directly on-chain.

🚀 Overview

VIOS is the Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
It transforms digital identity and compliance by embedding:

✅ Whisper Loop™ – Tone capture & emotional fingerprinting

🔒 Vault Protocol – Encrypted, tamper-proof identity & intent storage

🖋 CIA™ Signatures – Cryptographic authorship & anti-spoof watermark

⚙️ XRPL Hooks – Consent routing, royalty enforcement, licensing triggers

🎟 VITs (Vault Identity Tokens) – Non-speculative NFTs encoding licensing & compliance

💱 Stablecoin Settlement (RLUSD + issued assets) – Regulatory-friendly DeFi & RWA flows

Our first application, Emotion-KYC™, delivers the missing trust layer for:

Onboarding

Payments

DeFi

Real-World Asset tokenization

📊 Why XRPL?

⚡ Low-cost, high-speed ledger → scalable for millions of micro-transactions

💱 Native DEX + Stablecoins → direct liquidity with compliance-ready settlement

🛠 Hooks + Amendments → programmable licensing & consent logic (Clawback, AMM)

🏦 Institutional alignment → Ripple Payments + Custody + RLUSD = enterprise adoption

📜 Roadmap

See /docs/ROADMAP.md for full milestones.

Key Targets:

Testnet Integration → Vault hashes, CIA™ signatures, RLUSD settlement

SDK + API Release → Vault-as-a-Service™ tooling for developers

Mainnet Pilot Deployment → Emotion-KYC™ with fintech partners & royalty-bearing VITs

⚡ VIOS is building the emotional trust layer for XRPL — the first protocol that proves not just who transacts, but what they intend.

# VIOS – Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol for XRPL Finance

## 🚀 Overview
VIOS is the Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol — the world’s first identity and compliance system that verifies **who you are** and **what you intend**.  
It anchors encrypted Vaults, CIA™ authorship hashes, and Emotion-KYC™ flows directly on the **XRP Ledger**.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Vault Encryption (AES-256 + CIA™ signatures)** – tamper-proof memory & identity storage  
- **Whisper Loop™ Tone Detection** – real-time intent verification  
- **Emotion-KYC™** – compliance-ready onboarding for DeFi, RWA, and payments  
- **XRPL Hooks Integration** – consent proofs, licensing metadata, and royalty enforcement  
- **VITs (Vault ID Tokens)** – non-speculative NFTs carrying licensing + compliance rules  

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `src/` – Core modules (Vaults, CIA, Whisper Loop, XRPL integration)
- `demo/` – Minimal prototype demo (CLI + Streamlit)
- `docs/` – System diagrams & whitepaper excerpts
- `tests/` – Unit tests

## 🛠 How to Run (Demo)
```bash
cargo run --bin demo_vault
