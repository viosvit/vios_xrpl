⚡ *The Emotional Trust Layer for Global Finance — Built on XRPL*  

Emotion-KYC™ ensures not only **who** a user is but **what they intend** — anchoring authorship, compliance, and consent directly on-chain.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
VIOS is the **Proof-of-Emotion™ Protocol** for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).  
It transforms digital identity and compliance by embedding:  

✅ **Whisper Loop™** – Tone capture & emotional fingerprinting  
🔒 **Vault Protocol** – Encrypted, tamper-proof identity & intent storage  
🖋 **CIA™ Signatures** – Cryptographic authorship & anti-spoof watermark  
⚙️ **XRPL Hooks** – Consent routing, royalty enforcement, and licensing triggers  
🎟 **VITs (Vault Identity Tokens)** – Non-speculative NFTs encoding licensing & compliance  
💱 **Stablecoin Settlement (RLUSD + issued assets)** – Regulatory-friendly DeFi & RWA flows  

Our first application, **Emotion-KYC™**, delivers the missing trust layer for:  
- Onboarding  
- Payments  
- DeFi  
- Real-World Asset tokenization  

---

## 📊 Why XRPL?  
- ⚡ **Low-cost, high-speed ledger** → scalable for millions of micro-transactions  
- 💱 **Native DEX + Stablecoins** → direct liquidity with compliance-ready settlement  
- 🛠 **Hooks + Amendments** → programmable licensing & consent logic (Clawback, AMM)  
- 🏦 **Institutional alignment** → Ripple Payments + Custody + RLUSD = enterprise adoption  

---

## 📜 Roadmap  
See **/docs/ROADMAP.md** for full milestones.  

**Key Targets:**  
1. **Testnet Integration** → Vault hashes, CIA™ signatures, RLUSD settlement  
2. **SDK + API Release** → Vault-as-a-Service™ tooling for developers  
3. **Mainnet Pilot Deployment** → Emotion-KYC™ with fintech partners & royalty-bearing VITs
